Monthly meetings consist of a wide variety of topics ranging from relative news in the industry to presentations from guest speakers. We meet on the first Wednesday of every month around 7pm at the address below. Due to the venue having other events booked please check both back rooms as we may have moved to another room.  Sometimes we have game tournaments after our meetings!

Feel free to drop by anytime!
