LaWIT is an organization comprised of women dedicated to the fields of Technology, Engineering, and Science. No matter what tech-related field youâ€™re in, our organization provides a broad range of support and resources to advance women in Southern Louisiana.

We recognize the unique challenges women face in their professional careers. Our networking opportunities give members the chance to expand their professional contacts, and build upon skills and knowledge that will take their career to the next level.

LaWIT serves as a conduit between students and professionals, emphasizing the need for our next generation to pursue and master technology, engineering, and science careers. With the resources of the professional community behind it, LaWIT aims to raise awareness so that young women feel empowered to pursue a challenging, creative, and fulfilling career path.
