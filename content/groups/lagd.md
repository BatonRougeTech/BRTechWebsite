Louisiana Game Developers is an organization dedicated to fostering and promoting the game development community in Louisiana.

Our community welcomes students, professionals, and hobbyists creating everything from traditional video games to experimental interactive art!

We are inclusive of people from all walks of life, including people of different ethnic/racial/national backgrounds, sexual and gender identities, religions, ability, and vocations.
