This group is for both technical and business users - any and all who are interested in business analysis, data visualization, predictive modeling, traditional business intelligence, and everything in between. Please share this information with others who might be interested.

You may bring in your BI problems and we'll add it to the queue and discuss as time allows after the presentations are over.
