Lets build a vibrant Agile community together here in Baton Rouge.

The Geaux Agile meetup group focuses on discussing Agile related topics and techniques. Our goal is to create a collaborative forum where members of our Baton Rouge agile community can meet and discuss their experience, share ideas and techniques or learn more about incorporating or improving agile practices within their own organization.
